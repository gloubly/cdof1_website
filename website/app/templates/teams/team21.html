            <h2>Cybersecurity in databases</h2>
            <p>
                Our cybersecurity project focuses on safeguarding the entire mine-detection initiative. As the
                central cybersecurity team, our mission is to protect all data and communications between
                teams working on mine-detection technologies, including autonomous robots, image
                collection, and pathfinding. By following the ISO 27001 standard, we aim to ensure that sensitive
                information remains secure and protected against unauthorized access, cyberattacks, and data
                leaks.<br>
                This approach helps us uphold the three core pillars of cybersecurity: confidentiality, integrity,
                and availability (CIA).
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Confidentiality is ensured by encrypting sensitive data and managing access rights
                    strictly, so that only authorized personnel can view or modify critical information.
                </li>
                <li>Integrity is maintained through digital signatures and file versioning.</li>
                <li>
                    To guarantee availability, weâ€™ve introduced system redundancies, allowing autonomous
                    robots and algorithms to function seamlessly even if disruptions or attacks occur.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This comprehensive approach to cybersecurity is essential for the success of the entire project,
                as it prevents potential vulnerabilities that could compromise on-the-ground operations.
