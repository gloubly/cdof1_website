            <h2>Localization Project</h2>
            <p>üåç Humanitarian Demining Project: Precision Landmine Localization üåü<br>
                Our team is dedicated to creating an accurate and scalable landmine localization
                system, a critical component of a broader demining initiative.
            </p>
            <h3>üîç Focus:</h3>
                We specialize in the localization aspect of demining, leveraging cutting-edge GNSS RTK
                technology to achieve pinpoint accuracy within 10 cm, ensuring safe and effective
                operations.
            </p>
            <h3>ü§ù Collaboration:</h3>
            <p>
                Our work integrates seamlessly with other teams handling pathfinding, buried mine
                detection, and drone/robot-based marking, movement, and neutralization.
            </p>
            <h3>üìã Challenges:</h3>
            <ul>
                
                <li>
                    As engineering students not specialized in demining, we faced a steep learning
                    curve in mastering advanced technologies like GNSS RTK and understanding
                    international demining protocols.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Interdisciplinary collaboration pushed us to align with teams working on robotics,
                    sensors, and detection, ensuring full compatibility between components.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Developing a solution that is not only precise and reliable but also cost-effective
                    and scalable required balancing technical and practical constraints.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>üìã Goals:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Deliver a reliable, cost-effective solution adhering to international safetystandards.</li>
                <li>Provide detailed documentation and training materials for ease of adoption.</li>
                <li>Ensure scalability and compatibility with other technologies in the demining ecosystem.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>üë∑ Our Goal:</h3>
            <p>
                Empower humanitarian demining organizations with a safe, efficient, and scalable
                localization system, helping save lives and restore land to communities.<br>

            <h2>Acoustic detection Project</h2>
            <p>
                üåç Acoustic Sensors for Humanitarian Demining üé§<br>
                Our team is working on acoustic sensors to enhance landmine detection as part of a larger
                demining initiative. These sensors have the potential to revolutionize how buried mines are
                identified, offering a safe and innovative approach to this critical challenge.
            </p>
            <h3>üî¨ Our Work:</h3>
            <p>
                We're focusing on data collection to refine and validate our acoustic sensor technology.
                Here are our two main strategies:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Simulated Mine Testing:
                    Using 3D-printed mines from our fab lab, we aim to replicate realistic conditions, allowing
                    us to collect acoustic data in controlled environments and analyze the interaction of sound
                    waves with buried objects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Real-World Data Exploration:
                    We're investigating available datasets from regions heavily affected by landmines, such as
                    Ukraine, Russia, and Cambodia, to enrich our analysis and ensure our approach is
                    applicable in real-life scenarios.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>üéØ Why Acoustic Sensors?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Although acoustic sensors are commonly used for underwater mine detection, their
                    application for landmines remains relatively underexplored.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This technology could prove particularly valuable in muddy terrains, areas covered
                    with snow, or during heavy rainfall, where other methods might be less effective.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Non-invasive and adaptable, it offers a scalable solution suitable for diverse and challenging environments.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>üë∑ Our Goal:</h3>
            <p>
                To develop a precise and efficient acoustic sensor-based detection system,
                empowering humanitarian organizations with tools to safely and effectively identify
                landmines.<br>
